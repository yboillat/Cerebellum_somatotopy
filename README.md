# Cerebellum_somatotopy

This repository contains the scripts used in the paper entitled: "Whole-body somatotopic maps in the cerebellum revealed with 7T fMRI"

Part of the code was made with matlab while the other part is from the CBS tools toolbox (https://github.com/piloubazin/cbstools-public/)

The matlab code concerns mostly the generation of the label maps, extraction of values and statisitcs.
The CBS tools code concerns mostly the segmentation, normalization into MNI/CHROMA space and surface generation.

The matlab code depends on SPM and the Page test statistics are computed using code from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14419-perform-page-test
